                    <h3>The Fun of using TCP for an MMORPG</h3>
                    <p><bd>Carsten Griwodz, Pål Halvorsen</bd></p>
                    <p><h4>ABSTRACT</h4>Massive multi-player online games have become a popular,
fast growing, multi-million industry with a very high user
mass supporting hundreds or thousands of concurrent play-
ers. In many cases, these games are centralized and every
player communicates with the central server through a time-
critical unicast event stream. Funcom’s Anarchy Online is
one of these; it is based on TCP. We find that its kind of
traffic has some interesting properties that inspire changes
to protocol or architecture.
<br>
In these game streams, TCP does not back off, using TCP
does not have to be slower than using UDP, and almost
only repeated timeouts ruin the game experience. Improving
the latter in the sender implementation does not impose
any remarkable penalty on the network. Alternatively, a
proxy architecture for multiplexing could save about 40%
resources at the server, allow congestion control to work and
also reduce the lag of the game.

                    <h3>An Empirical Evaluation of TCP Performance in Online Games</h3>
                    <p><bd>Kuan-Ta Chen, Chun-Ying Huang, Polly Huang, and Chin-Laung Lei</bd></p>
                    <p><h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
A fundamental design question to ask in the development
of a network game is—Which transport protocol should be
used—TCP, UDP, or some other protocols? Seeking an objective
answer to the choice of communication protocol for
MMORPGs, we assess whether TCP, a popular choice, is
suitable for MMORPGs based on empirical evidence. To
the best of our knowledge, this work is the first evaluation of
transport protocol performance using real-life game traces.
We analyze a 1, 356-million-packet trace from ShenZhou
Online, a TCP-based, commercial, mid-sized MMORPG.
Our analysis indicates that TCP is unwieldy and inappropriate
for MMORPGs. This is due to four distinctive characteristics
of MMORPG traffic: 1) tiny packets, 2) low packet
rate, 3) application-limited traffic generation, and 4) bidirectional
traffic. We show that because TCP was originally
designed for unidirectional and network-limited bulk
data transfers, it cannot adapt well to MMORPG traffic. In
particular, the window-based congestion control and the fast
retransmit algorithm for loss recovery are ineffective. Furthermore,
TCP is overkill, as not every game packet needs
to be transmitted in a reliably and orderly manner. We also
show that the degraded network performance did impact
users’ willingness to continue a game. Finally, we discuss
guidelines in designing transport protocols for online games.<br>

                    <h3>On the effectiveness of an optimization method for the traffic of TCP-based multiplayer online games</h3>
                    <p><bd>Jose Saldana</bd></p>
                    <p><h4>ABSTRACT</h4> This paper studies the feasibility of using an optimization method, based on multiplexing and header compression, for the traffic of Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) using TCP at the Transport Layer. Different scenarios where a number of flows share a common network path are identified. The adaptation of the multiplexing method is explained, and a formula of the savings is devised. The header compression ratio is obtained using real traces of a popular game and a statistical model of its traffic is used to obtain the bandwidth saving as a function of the number of players and the multiplexing period. The obtained savings can be up to 60 % for IPv4 and 70 % for IPv6. A Mean Opinion Score model from the literature is employed to calculate the limits of the multiplexing period that can be used without harming the user experience. The interactions between multiplexed and non-multiplexed flows, sharing a bottleneck with different kinds of background traffic, are studied through simulations. As a result of the tests, some limits for the multiplexing period are recommended: the unfairness between players can be low if the value of the multiplexing period is kept under 10 or 20 ms. TCP background flows using SACK (Selective Acknowledgment) and Reno yield better results, in terms of fairness, than Tahoe and New Reno. When UDP is used for background traffic, high values of the multiplexing period may stress the unfairness between flows if network congestion is severe.</p>

Communication Using OPNET Custom Application</h3>
<p><bd>Sarmad A. Abdulazeez, Abdennour El Rhalibi, Dhiya Al-Jumeily </bd></p>

                    <p><h4>ABSTRACT</h4>  In recent years, there has been an important growth
in online gaming. Nowadays, Massively Multiplayer Online
Games (MMOGs) may involve millions of synchronous players
scattered around the world and engaging with each other
within a single shared game. In this paper, we propose a new
technique to communicate between players and game server,
and between them based on hybrid Peer-to-Peer architecture.
We propose to use OPNET Modeler 18.0, and in particular the
custom application to simulate the new architecture, which
required the implementation of new nodes models and
behaviors in the simulator to emulate correctly the new
architecture. We use OPNET Modeler 18.0 to simulate the
network, applying two transport protocols TCP and UDP, and
with different scenarios. The scenarios include both clientserver
and hybrid P2P system to evaluate the communication
of games with (125, 500, and 1000) peers. <br>

                    <p><h4>ABSTRACT</h4>  Multiplayer games are representative of a large
class of distributed applications that suffer from redundant
communication, bottlenecks, single points of failure and poor
reactivity to changing network conditions. Many of these
problems can be alleviated through simple network adaptations
at the infrastructure level. In this paper, we describe a
model in which game packets are directed along the edges of
a rooted tree connecting the players, aggregated during the
upstream flight and multicast from the root to the leaves. This
tree is constructed based on a heuristic, and can dynamically
adjust itself in response to changes in network conditions.
This gaming infrastructure is built and maintained using active
networks, which is currently the only open architecture
suitable for these types of applications.
<br>
We have designed and implemented a prototype using
ANTS that performs these adaptations for unmodified
DOOM clients. We present analytical and simulation results
that illustrate the reduction in communication overhead, and
show that the multicast tree can quickly adjust to changing
network conditions. The overhead of the active network-based middleware is acceptable, especially in wide-area
networks.<br>

                    <p><h4>ABSTRACT</h4>Networked multiplayer games are a multibillion dollar business: some games now attract tens of millions of players. In this practical, code-rich guide, Joshua Glazer and Sanjay Madhav guide you through every aspect of engineering them. Drawing on their immense experience as both game developers and instructors, the authors lead you through building a robust multiplayer architecture, and creating every engine-level system. You’ll learn through in-depth working code examples for two complete games: an action game and a real time strategy (RTS) game.
<br>
First, Madhav and Glazer review the essentials of networking and network programming from the standpoint of game developers. Next, they walk through managing game data transmission, updating game objects across the network, and organizing the devices that join your game. You’ll learn how to ensure reliable performance despite the Internet’s inherent inconsistencies, and how to design game code for maximum security and scalability. The authors conclude by addressing two increasingly crucial issues: incorporating gamer services and hosting your games in the cloud.<br>
